                     alt="JLab Audio">
            </figure>
            <p>The Go Air is the newest pair of wireless earbuds by JLab Audio, a company known for its great
                bang-for-your-buck headphones and earbuds. The Go Air are particularly interesting because they have
                similar
                features to many other wireless earbuds on the market — IPX4 water-resistance (same as AirPods Pro),
                5-hours
                of battery life per earbud, and charging case that adds 15 extra hours (total) — and yet they cost just
                $29.
                That’s cheaper than many AirPods knockoffs that you can buy on Amazon. Heck, that’s cheaper than it
                costs to
                replace a lost AirPods (with AppleCare+). But at such a low price, these wireless earbuds can’t be good,
                right?
                Well, you might be surprised. At a $29 price point, of course the JLab Go Air do not deliver incredible
                sound quality. But they are listenable and astoundingly reliable which makes them a great buy.</p>
            <h3>The charging case is both interesting and frustrating.</h3>
            <p>Right out of the gate you can see some of the corners JLab cut to get to this rock bottom price point.
                The Go
                Air does not include a wall adapter, for instance. Instead, there is a cable attached to the charging
                case,
                with a USB-A male connector, so you have to plug the case directly int a wall adapter or charger you
                already
                own.
                The case also has no lid, presumably because a single piece with no hinge is cheaper to manufacture. The
                earbuds are held in place by relatively strong magnets, but without an actual lid, they are do have the
                potential to pop right out at any time. I was still able to dislodge them with one fell smack, similar
                to
                how you might get the last pair of Tic Tacs unstuck from the bottom of the container. A fun way to get
                your
                earbuds out, but definitely a danger if you drop the case.</p>
            <h3>The sound quality is predictably mediocre, but far from unlistenable.</h3>
            <p>I’m not here to tell you that the sound quality is great. In fact, it’s not. The bass is not very
                prominent
                and there’s a slight crackling in the background at times, especially when listening to pump-up pop and
                R&B
                music at high volumes, and it just can sound harsh. But then again, that’s what you get with a lot of
                really
                affordable headphones. It’s not gonna blow you away, but if you’re not somebody who just wants to listen
                to
                music on your commute or during a workout — yes, these are IPX4 — the JLab Go Air are likely to be fine.
                In
                fact, you’ll probably be over the moon that you didn’t have to drop $159 on AirPods or another
                “high-end”
                pair of wireless earbuds. And if you primarily listen to audiobooks or podcasts, they’re more than
                sufficient.</p>
            <h3>They’re dependable, which is more than you can say about a lot of wireless earbuds.</h3>
            <p>In my week of testing the earbuds’ audio never cut out, I never had any issues with fit or having them
                fall
                out of my earbuds, and I had never had any problems with battery life. In fact I was pleasantly
                surprised
                with how long they could go between charges. What’s more, they actually have some modern conveniences
                that
                you’d find in higher-end earbuds, such has sweat resistance and capacitive touch controls for play/pause
                and
                initiating your smartphone’s voice assistant. There’s even touch controls for adjusting the music’s EQ,
                though I can’t say the different modes made much of a difference.

                All in all, the JLab Go Air are impressively competent for how cheap they are, and as such make terrific
                back-up buds or even daily drivers for those who are far more concerned about pricetags than sound
                quality.</p>

            <p>Middleweight performance sedans are quite in vogue with luxury carmakers. Whether it’s Mercedes-AMG‘s
                -43 and -53 line, BMW’s M Sport cars or Cadillac’s Vsport V brand, the idea of using the reputation
                of super-sporty models to help move semi-sporty ones is both popular and profitable these days.
                Audi, however, has been building these sorts of cars for a very long time. Its S models straddle the
                line between the conventional A-branded (and now Q-branded) luxury cars and the track-ready,
                tire-shredding RS vehicles.
                These S cars have become such a regular part of the model planning cadence that the carmaker doesn’t
                even make much of a big deal about rolling them out anymore. Normally, for the launch of a new
                model, an automaker brings journalists to a central location and gives them an entire day to drive
                them along a choreographed route that provides maximum time in a single car. For the launch of the
                S6, S7 and S8? Audi turned us loose on a mixed flock of cars and told us to frolic in the hills west
                of Silicon Valley as we saw fit.

            <p>
                Breville’s Bambino espresso machine is the most compact and affordable in its lineup. The Bambino Plus
                pulls useful tech from Breville’s larger, pricier options — a three-second heat-up time, shot
                pre-infusion and its fairly incredible milk wand — while maintaining a consistent, reliable flavor
                profile. It’s also $100 off today on Amazon.

                Unlike some its larger models, the Bambino does not come with a grinder or doser built-in. The process
                to making espresso on it is as follows: tamp, trim, press a button. Today, you can get one for $100 off
                its regular $500 retail price.
